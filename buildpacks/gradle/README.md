## Building a container image with Buildpacks and Spring Boot

```shell
./gradlew bootBuildImage
```

Run the containerized application

docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 demo-buildpacks:1.0
```

Browse the SBOMs generated by Buildpacks for each image layer

```shell
http :8080/actuator/sbom
```

## Extracting the SBOMs from each layer of the image with pack

```shell
pack sbom download demo-buildpacks:1.0 --output-dir image-sboms
```

## Scanning the SBOMs for security vulnerabilities with Trivy
