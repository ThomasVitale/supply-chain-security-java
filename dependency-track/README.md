# Managing Supply Chain Security Risks with DependencyTrack

[DependencyTrack](https://dependencytrack.org) is an open-source platform for managing supply chain security risks
through continuous SBOM analysis.

Run the DependencyTrack API Server and Frontend:

```shell
docker compose up -d
```

You can now access DependencyTrack at http://localhost:9090.

The first time you log in (`admin/admin`), you'll be asked to update the password to something more secure.
